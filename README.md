# Information

Originally started as a fork from [Quackster/Kepler](https://github.com/Quackster/Kepler),
Trax Server is a updated version of havana in security focused implementation.
Trax has a lot of new features that protect your retro from malicious attacks like DDoS/DoS.


Trax is an Independent Project combined my security knowledge, with a passion of old school Habbo Hotel.
Trax protects your Retro From Bad Actors, due to security flaws in Shockwave.

This Project Can be used using the official Havana repository, but using the Trax-Server with Security features.

I Hope you Like Trax, and their security features, i will add in the future.

The Reason of the security flaws on old school retros, is because the version of the client is very ancient. and Trax-Server is here to do a solution of that problem.
